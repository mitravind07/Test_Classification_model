## 🚀 Approach Summary

This project demonstrates a full NLP pipeline for sentiment classification using the IMDB dataset. The task was to fine-tune a pre-trained transformer (DistilBERT) using Hugging Face Transformers.

## 🧠 Model Decisions

- **Model Chosen**: `distilbert-base-uncased`, selected for its balance between performance and speed.
- **Tokenizer**: Used Hugging Face's tokenizer with `padding='max_length'` and `truncation=True`.
- **Loss Function**: CrossEntropy (implicitly handled by the Hugging Face `Trainer`).
- **Trainer**: Used Hugging Face `Trainer` API to manage training and evaluation.

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy**: Automatically computed by `Trainer.evaluate()`.
- **Classification Report**: Includes Precision, Recall, and F1-score printed using `sklearn.metrics.classification_report`.

## 📊 Results

The model successfully learned to classify movie reviews into positive and negative sentiment with reasonable accuracy. Sample predictions are also provided in `inference.py`.

## 🌐 Multilingual Extension (Bonus)

To extend this pipeline to multilingual text classification:

- Use `xlm-roberta-base` instead of DistilBERT.
- Load a multilingual dataset such as `amazon_reviews_multi`.
- Update tokenizer and model references accordingly.
